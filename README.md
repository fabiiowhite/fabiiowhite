### Hi there, I'm Fabio ðŸ‘‹

It has been 3 years now since I learned how to code, and so far I can say that the journey has been thrilling. 
I started at the same time I started University, falling in love with algorithmic thinking/logic and living my life as if 
it's programmed with 'if-else' statements. ðŸ¤”

I'm currently diving into âš¡ React.js and ðŸŒ± UI/UX systems. Although I sometimes find myself going back to my toxic relationships 
with Java and Python (appearently I can't stop ðŸ’¬ thinking about them).
