### Hi there, I'm Fabio 👋

It has been 3 years now since I learned how to code, and so far I can say that the journey has been thrilling. 
I started at the same time I started University, falling in love with algorithmic thinking/logic and living my life as if 
it's programmed with 'if-else' 🤔 statements.

I'm currently diving into the realm of Cyber Security 🛡️. Although I sometimes find myself going back to my toxic relationships 
with Java and Python (appearently I can't stop 💬 thinking about them).
